# Add-TER-to-.pdb-file
This script will add missing TER line(s), which indicate the end of a chain of residues, to a .pdb file that has been messed up manually in Coot. The script will also increase the atom serial number up for all subsequent lines to avoid repeating or misordered serial numbers.
You will need to specify your input .pdb file with -i and output file with -o. Do give the output a different name to the input and output! As .pdb files are justified (not tab or comma delimited) the script takes input to direct it to the locations of the atom serial number and chain IDs. Please do eyeball your .pbd file in a text veiwer and check these locations against the defaults specified for -a (atom serial number) and -c (chain ID). Note: this script will not add a TER line to the end of the last chain, but that is easy to do manually as you don't need to change the atom number for all subsequent entries! :)
Usage notes can be found in the comments at the top of the files. Help with the arguments can be found by typing 'python add_TER.py -h' into the command line.
